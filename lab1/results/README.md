# RESULTS FOLDER

- By default, this folder might be empty. All of result image will be save in here instead show on pop up.
- Because moodle have 10 MB limitation for upload. I must delete all images generated in this folder. To regenerate, you can follow [here](../README.md) to run all lab. All picture will be here then.
