# LAB 1 - Fundamental Image Processing with OpenCV

- In this lab, I do all requirement with python code instead jupyter notebook. So, I save picture to `results` folder instead just show images after processing.

- To run all lab, you just command. `OpenCV` and `matplotlib` are require
    ```py
    python3 main.py
    ```
